# ShortName
ShortName is a simple function built in PHP to generate lowercase hyphenated strings in PHP for IDs or URLs
Simply add the ShortName function to your PHP code and pass your original string in to the function when calling it. The function takes only one argument - the original string, and returns only one value - the lowercase hyphenated version of the string with special characters removed (suitable for use in URLs, file names, or as record IDs in a database).
